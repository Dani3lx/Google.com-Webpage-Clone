# [Google.com-Webpage-Clone](https://dani3lx.github.io/Google.com-Webpage-Clone/)

This is a simple imitation of the google.com search page as well as the google image search page. 
Main search page contains:
  - A link to the google image search page
  - A text field that takes in a text input and redirects the user to the google search result of the query when the user types enter or clicks on the **Google Search** button
  - A **I'm Feeling Lucky** button that redirects the user to the first search result of the query
  
Image search contains:
  - A link back to the main search page
  - A text field that takes in a text input and redirects the user to the google image search result of the query when the user types enter

Both pages are created using html, as well as css to imitate the original Google search page.
